## Price Increase Recommendation
From 2021 to 2022, a 25% price increase led to a 64% rise in demand, suggesting strong customer tolerance. Assuming a linear relationship, a slight additional price increase is unlikely to significantly reduce demand. The calculated price elasticity of 2.56 indicates demand is relatively inelasticâ€”meaning moderate price hikes can still be profitable.
